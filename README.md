<h1>The REAL Centre</h1>
<h2>The REAL Centre's beta version GitHub setup</h2>
<p>The Health Foundation’s REAL Centre (Research and Economic Analysis for the Long term) provides independent analysis and research to support better long-term decision making in health and social care. Its aim is to help health and social care leaders and policymakers look beyond the short term to understand the implications of their future funding and resourcing decisions. The Centre will work in partnership with leading experts and academics to research and model the future demand for care, and the workforce and other resources needed to respond. The Centre supports the Health Foundation's aim to create a more sustainable health and care system that better meets people’s needs now and in the future.</p>
